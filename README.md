# Databricks Architect Playbook

**Hands-on, end-to-end Databricks architecture playbook covering greenfield, migration, ingestion patterns, costing, and governance across Azure, AWS, and GCP.**

## Overview
This repository represents my hands-on journey to mastering Databricks as a **delivery architect**, focusing on real-world architecture, migration, and enterprise governance scenarios.

## What this repository demonstrates
- Greenfield Databricks architecture (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Batch, streaming, and CDC ingestion patterns
- Enterprise migration strategies (Oracle/SQL Server, Hadoop/Hive, Snowflake)
- Costing, sizing, and proposal design
- Security, governance, and Unity Catalog implementation
